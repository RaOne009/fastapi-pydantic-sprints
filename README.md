## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… **FastAPI** for high-performance backend API endpoints  
- âœ… **Pydantic** for data validation, type enforcement, and request/response modeling  
- âœ… **Streamlit** for interactive front-end to visualize predictions  
- âœ… **ML model integration** using a `.pkl` file to predict patient insurance premium  
- âœ… Clear code structure for learning and reusability

## ðŸ“Š Project Use Case: Insurance Premium Prediction

An end-to-end system where users input patient data via a **Streamlit UI**, which then communicates with a **FastAPI backend** to serve predictions from a trained **ML model** (e.g., linear regression or random forest).

### Example Inputs:
- Age  
- BMI  
- Number of children  
- Smoker (Yes/No)  
- Region

### Example Output:
- Predicted Insurance Premium ðŸ’°
